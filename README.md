# Sentiment Analysis App

This project consists of a **Flutter** frontend and a **Flask** backend for sentiment analysis. The backend processes requests and returns sentiment predictions (0=negative, 1=neutral, or 2=positive).

### ðŸ§© My Contributions

My contributions to this sentiment analysis project included key responsibilities across the data pipeline and parts of the model development process:

- **Data Collection:**  
  Curated and aggregated a diverse dataset for sentiment classification, ensuring coverage across multiple sentiment classes and domains.

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  - Removed noise such as stopwords, special characters, and punctuation.  
  - Normalized text via lowercasing and lemmatization.  
  - Handled missing values and performed label encoding for categorical targets.

- **Text Tokenization:**  
  Tokenized the text data for model compatibility using NLTK.

- **Model Training & Evaluation (Support):**  
  Collaborated on model selection and tuning. Supported training runs and contributed to evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
